# password-generator

1. I created variables that contained all the characters needed for the password

2. I created an empty string that will contain the final password the +=  in the prpmpts will add a character to the variabel based on if the statement holds true. 

3. I created a series of if statements that hold a value of true or false, and based on the answer, it will execute some code. 

4. I created a for loop that will be stored in a variable, it will represent the length of the prompt in the first question.

5. I create a math function that will generate a random password based on the characters stored (CharAT)

6. I returned the variable that holds the password and the function will execute.
